# A REST-based weather serviceThe goal of your case is to develop a small REST based service to retrieve information about the weather in different cities. The service should be powered by node.js and utilize the data from openweathermap.org. The list of available cities can be found [here](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz).Besides the requirement to use node.js, you are free to use any library or tool you need to develop the service.

If you have any question, feel free to contact me mail (barth@stocard.de).

Please use git for tracking your progress. For handing the case in, please share a link to a public git repo or use git-bundle (https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/10/bundles.html) and share the file with me.

Feel encouraged to dockerize your test and add a meaningful set of tests.

## RoutesThe following routes should be provided by the service. All the routes should deliver the response as json and indicate the response type with the proper content type.### `GET /cities?lat={latitude}&lng={longitude}`List the available cities around the specified latitude/longitude within a radius of 10 kilometers Example: http://localhost:8080/cities?lat=49.48&lng=8.46Returns:
* `HTTP 200 Ok` with body:
```js[  {"id":2873891,"name":"Mannheim"}, {"id":6555232,"name":"Altrip"}, ...]
```* `HTTP 400 Bad Request` if parameters are missing:
```js
{
  "code":"BadRequestError",
  "message":"lat/lng required"	
}```### `GET /cities/{city_id}`Retrieve the details for a city (by city_id) Example: http://localhost:8080/cities/2873891Returns:
* `HTTP 200 Ok` with body:
```js{  "id":2873891,  "name":"Mannheim", "lat":49.488331, "lng":8.46472}
```* `HTTP 404 Not Found` if the city_id was not found:
```js
{  "code":"NotFoundError",  "message":"not found"
}
```

### `GET /cities/{city_id}/weather`Retrieve the weather data for a city (by city_id) Example: http://localhost:8080/cities/2873891/weatherReturns:

* `HTTP 200 Ok` with body:
```js
{  "type": "Clear",
  "type_description": "clear sky",
  "sunrise": "2016-08-23T08:00:00.000Z",
  "sunset": "2016-08-23T22:00:00.000Z",
  "temp": 29.72,  "temp_min": 26.67,  "temp_max": 35,  "pressure": 1026,  "humidity": 36,  "clouds_percent": 0,  "wind_speed": 1.5}
```
* `HTTP 404 Not Found` if the city_id was not found:
```js
{  "code":"NotFoundError",  "message":"not found"
}
```### Getting startedThe following libraries and tools could be helpful to implement the service:* restify (http://restify.com/) ­ as the baseline to implement the REST web service* request (https://github.com/request/request) ­ to make requests to the http://openweathermap.org/ API
* postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) or curl to test the service
